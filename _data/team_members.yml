  title: Principle Investigator
  research_interests: "Prof. Dr. Christian Fiebach's research interests primarily revolve around cognitive neuroscience, with a particular focus on understanding the neural mechanisms underlying human perception, memory, and decision-making processes. His work often involves employing neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and computational modeling to investigate how these cognitive functions are represented in the brain and how they are influenced by various factors such as aging, individual differences, and neurological disorders. Additionally, he explores the application of cognitive neuroscience findings in educational contexts, aiming to enhance learning and cognitive training methods."

  title: Scientific Coordinator
  research_interests: My professional experience in recent years has been mainly in science management and scientific coordination of national and international projects. My research interests as a computer scientist lie in the areas of information retrieval and sentiment analysis in online social platforms, as well as research data and knowledge management. I have extensive experience in the application of Natural Language Processing and Linked Open Data in the development of domain-specific knowledge graphs for national projects and international consortia.

  title: Senior Scientist 
  research_interests: My research focuses on three connected topics 1) predictive processing; 2) neural oscillations in speech and language comprehension; 3) integration of cognitive and bodily rhythms. I am interested in the nature of predictive representations (e.g., sensory or motor?), and their neural implementation (plausibly, via inhibitory interneuronal activity). I think the temporal nature of speech may be dynamically encoded by the activity of neural oscillators (this is the main topic of my DFG Eigene Stelle), but not the ‘atemporal’ information about language structure. Bodily rhythms, especially changes in respiratory, heart-beat rates and eye movements, help optimize higher-order perceptual processes.

  title: Postdoctoral Researcher
  research_interests: My research currently focuses on the earliest stages of visual word recognition - especially visual and orthographic processing of visual words. I am very interested in early event-related potentials (ERPs) from M/EEG, the information that can be decoded from these signals, and the degree to which these signals may capture or reflect prediction error. I am also very interested in the application of non-traditional statistical models to describe phenomena like ERPs and behaviour, as a way of improving inferences that can be drawn about neuro-cognition.

  title: Postdoctoral Researcher
  research_interests: As a trained linguist, my research interests lie in speech and language processing. Currently, I am part of the ARENA project (Abstract Representations in Neural Architectures) which investigates how the brain encodes different levels of knowledge abstraction by using Large-Language Models and other computational approaches. I am also interested in how the brain encodes/decodes the temporal structure of linguistic information at different timescales.
